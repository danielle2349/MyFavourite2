        <p>  My hobby is Baking! I love baking alot becasue it's fun to do and its one of my favourite things to do. I like baking cakes, cupcakes, brownies and making creme brulees. When i grow up i want to do something in the Food industry!! I like baking because You can control what goes into them, such as the amount of sugar; it is possible to modify home-baked goods to reduce fat and sugar, the flavour is superior, you have the satisfaction of having baked your own goods.<br> <br> Some skills you learn from baking are:
        Organization, Attention to Detail and Patience and Dedication </p>
